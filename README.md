### TODO

- detection if JSTC is on the page - currently we display nothing
- autoscrolling event list upon new event
- payload validation for events and network events
- grouping parameters in network event details
- better display of parameters
- highlight significant params that contributed to event detection https://help.piwik.pro/support/questions/what-are-events-and-how-are-they-detected/#how-event-types-are-detected
- settings & persistence
- pretty icon next to network events like in tracker debugger
- events order toggle - newest/oldest first
- support for viewing direct method calls on tracker object, currently we only have information on \_paq/\_ppas.push()
- formatting and syntax highlighting for functions - pushed to queue and to methods like `setCustomRequestProcessing`
- playwright tests
- setup eslint
